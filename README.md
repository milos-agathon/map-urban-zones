# Map urban zones
In this repo, I'll show you how to use the GHS built-up characteristics dataset, which provides information on the spatial distribution and morphology of built-up areas around the world. You'll learn how to use ggplot2 in R to create maps of Morphological Settlement Zones, which are clusters of built-up cells with similar characteristics.
